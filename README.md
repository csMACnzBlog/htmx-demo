# HTMX Demo

This is an htmx demo. You can play around at https://blog.csmac.nz/htmx-demo/.

This is a demo of functionality using [htmx](https://htmx.org/) over static pages. Because it is using static pages, there are places where `GET` is used instead of `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` to make the demo appear to work. Specifically, the form is completely smoke-and-mirrors where no server exists to run validations or accept the response.

Tools used:

* HTMX - https://htmx.org/
* Pico CSS - https://picocss.com/
